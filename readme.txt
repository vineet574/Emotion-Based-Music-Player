Emotion-Based Music Player ðŸŽµ
Description
The Emotion-Based Music Player is a Python project that uses facial recognition and emotion detection to play music that matches the user's detected mood. The application uses OpenCV for real-time face detection, a pre-trained deep learning model for emotion classification, and Pygame to play the corresponding music based on the detected emotion.

Features
Real-time face detection using OpenCV.
Emotion recognition using a pre-trained deep learning model.
Plays different music tracks based on detected emotions.
Easy to set up and use on any system with a webcam.
Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV
TensorFlow/Keras
Numpy
Pygame
Setup and Installation
To set up and run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone this Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Emotion-Based-Music-Player.git
cd Emotion-Based-Music-Player
Install the Required Libraries: Make sure you have Python installed. Install the necessary libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python numpy tensorflow pygame
Add the Model File and Music Files:

Model: Ensure you have the pre-trained emotion detection model (emotion_model.h5) in the same directory as the script.
Music Files: Place the music files (e.g., happy_song.mp3, sad_song.mp3) in the music folder. Update the path to the music folder in the script if needed.
Run the Application: Run the Python script to start the application:

bash
Copy code
python emotion_music_player.py
How to Use
When you run the script, the webcam will start, and the application will begin detecting your face in real time.
The application will analyze your facial expressions and detect your current emotion (e.g., happy, sad, angry).
Based on the detected emotion, the corresponding music will play.
Press 'q' to quit the application.

Notes
Ensure your webcam is connected and functional before running the application.
The model file (emotion_model.h5) must be present in the project directory.
Add or modify music files in the music folder to suit your preference.
Future Enhancements
Add support for more emotions and corresponding music files.
Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
Improve the emotion detection model for higher accuracy.
